TO BE CARRIED OUT AWAY FROM ANY ELECTROMAGNETIC SOURCES

Because calibration must be done once the project is finished

Because even if the design is correct, the real world is not ideal.

Calibration is not used to correct the code, but to compensate for physical tolerances that you cannot eliminate.

The 4 REAL reasons


1- The photo interruptor:

has variable threshold

different rise times

jitter on the front

Your trimmer adjusts where the actual pulse is triggered.


2- The disc:

it is not perfectly centered on the motor axis

It has holes with micro-differences

it can swing

At 50,000 RPM every micro error multiplies.


3- Real electronics

Even with correct pull-ups, series resistor and PCNT filters

remain:

delays

rebounds

EMI

Calibration absorbs the residual systematic error.


4- Absolute reference

Your tachometer does not measure “true RPM”
measures pulses / time.

RPMs only become “true” when you compare them to a known instrument.

What calibration is NOT

It's not a piece of cake
It's not because "the code is wrong"
It is not mandatory every time you turn it on

It is a factory calibration.
